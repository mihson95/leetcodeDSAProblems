## Solution
The first loop is used to fill the even indices of the v array with the most frequent character ch in s. The loop runs for mx times, where mx is the frequency of ch in s. The loop iterates through every other index of the array v, starting at index 0, and fills it with the value of ch. If the loop reaches an index greater than or equal to n (i.e., it goes out of bounds), it returns an empty string.
The second loop iterates through the mp map, which contains the frequency of each character in s, and fills in the remaining odd indices of the v array with the other characters. For each character that is not ch, the loop runs k times, where k is the frequency of the character in s. The loop iterates through every other index of the v array, starting at index 1, and fills it with the value of the current character. If the loop reaches an index greater than or equal to n (i.e., it goes out of bounds), it sets i to 1 to fill in the next odd index.

## Time Complexity
Time Complexity depends upon number of iterations happening. In the last loop, the number of iteration is equal to the number of elements in the array. Each element of array is iterated over exactly once.
So Time Complexity is O(N). In the worst case, the array v is completely filled in the last loop.
